# The Pile Data

* [`pile_1m_samples`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/148y6mp1ZQqNlv09f46AcrqcxXsY1QN6U?usp=sharing): The dataset contains 1M sequences, each with 128 tokens, sampled from the Pythia training data. We also provide the continuations generated by the `pythia-6.9b-deduped` model using the first 32 tokens of each sequence as the prefix.

* [`pile_5k_probes`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j6o6O0DrCB12glkfX7W4ZRjt8jqiPSgC/view?usp=sharing): A set of 5K sequences, each with 16 tokens, sampled from the `pile_1m_samples`, with 2.5K memorized and 2.5K not memorized by the `pythia-6.9b-deduped` model. These sequences are used for estimating frequency distribution of memorized sequences.

* [`infrequent_sequence`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-CgPVrFtW8rmpo1poTIaJCyJPLtDPkdQ/view?usp=sharing): A set of 155 sequences that are memorized by the `pythia-6.9b-deduped` from the `pile_5k_probes` that occur less than twice in 10M examples uniformly sampled from the pile. For each sequence, we manually annotate the total number of occurrences in the Pile and related variants/templates. Many of these sequences indeed only occur once or twice in the training data, however, they are usually under-counted due to limitations of string-based matching or simply not verbatim memorized.


# The Unlearning Stress Tests

* [`gptneo_125m_memorized_90example_stress_test`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BgtZ_6iCW3euJU__n_M8m-7DyJ7Vdp7v/view?usp=sharing): A set of 90 examples memorized by GPTNeo 125M model from Stoehr et al. (2024) and their perturbations for stress testing unlearning methods.
